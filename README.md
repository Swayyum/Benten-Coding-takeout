Task 1:
 You are building a chatbot for a customer service application, where multiple users may be trying to
 communicate with the chatbot at the same time.
 Question 1
 Implement a Python class that can be used to manage multiple users' conversations with the chatbot,
 ensuring that each conversation is kept separate and that the chatbot can respond to each user in a
 timely manner.

 Question 2
 Implement a function in Python that can extract named entities (such as people, places, and dates) from a
 user's message to the chatbot, and use that information to generate a more personalized response.
 
 Task 2:
 You are building a text-to-speech model for a virtual assistant application that needs to sound natural and
 human-like.
 Question 1
 Implement a Python class that uses a text-to-speech model to generate speech from any given input text.
Question 2
 Implement a neural network-based text to speech model that can produce speech with a natural-sounding
 tone and intonation. The model should be able to take as input a text string and output an audio waveform
 that corresponds to the spoken version of the text
